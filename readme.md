# Alarm Clock 

## A skinnable alarm clock

![Full Clock.png](_Docs/FFull%20Clock.png)

I believe I had to catch a flight somewhere 2006-2007 but had neither a phone nor alarm clock. 
Rather than buy or borrow an alarm clock I hastily cobbled together an application. 
Then, being young and an eager fool, I got carried away.

I plan to refactor this code and modernise it.
